<h3> Unveiling the Mystery of Cross-Platform Rust Compilation: From Linux to Windows </h3>

**Introduction**
<br>
A few days ago, I started writing ransomware(just for learn) with Rust Programming Language, I Developing this Ransomware in Linux But I wanted it for Windows, and thatâ€™s when a question came to me, how can I compile the Rust code for a Windows with my Linux OS.

First, I want to talk about what happens when we compile a file?
I simply say; We compile the sample main.rs file with the official Rust compiler, rustc When we are in Windows, we receive main.exe as an executable file from the compiler, and when we are in Linux, we receive main.bin but why is it like this?
